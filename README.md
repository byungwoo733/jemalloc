jemalloc
===========

Summary
-------
The version of _jemalloc_ used in Open webOS

Description
-----------
This is a minimal-effort stand-alone _jemalloc_ distribution for Linux.  The main
rough spots are:

* __isthreaded must be hard-coded, since the pthreads library really needs to
  be involved in order to toggle it at run time.  Therefore, this distribution
  builds two separate libraries:

  + libjemalloc_mt.so.0 : Use for multi-threaded applications.
  + libjemalloc.so.0 : Use for single-threaded applications.

  Both libraries link against libpthread, though with a bit more code hacking,
  this dependency could be removed for the single-threaded version.

* MALLOC_MAG (thread-specific caching, using magazines) is disabled, because
  special effort is required to avoid memory leaks when it is enabled.  To make
  cleanup automatic, we would need help from the pthreads library.  If you
  enable MALLOC_MAG, be sure to call _malloc_thread_cleanup() in each thread
  just before it exits.

* The code that determines the number of CPUs is sketchy.  The trouble is that
  we must avoid any memory allocation during early initialization.

Dependencies
============

Below are the tools (and their minimum versions) required to build _jemalloc_:

- cmake (version required by cmake-modules-webos)
- gcc 4.6.3
- make (any version)
- openwebos/cmake-modules-webos 1.0.0 RC2

How to Build on Linux
=====================

## Building

Once you have downloaded the source, enter the following to build it (after
changing into the directory under which it was downloaded):

    $ mkdir BUILD
    $ cd BUILD
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The directory under which the files are installed defaults to `/usr/local/webos`.
You can install them elsewhere by supplying a value for `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`
when invoking `cmake`. For example:

    $ cmake -D WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT:PATH=$HOME/projects/webosose ..
    $ make
    $ make install

will install the files in subdirectories of `$HOME/projects/webosose`.

Specifying `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` also causes `pkg-config` to look in that tree
first before searching the standard locations. You can specify additional
directories to be searched prior to this one by setting the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`
environment variable.

If not specified, `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT` defaults to `/usr/local/webos`.

To configure for a debug build, enter:

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..

To see a list of the make targets that `cmake` has generated, enter:

    $ make help

To enable HEAP_TRACKING feature pass the value of CMAKE_C_FLAGS set as 
-DHEAP_TRACKING as follows:

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS=-DHEAP_TRACKING ..

## Uninstalling

From the directory where you originally ran `make install`, enter:

    $ [sudo] make uninstall

You will need to use `sudo` if you did not specify `WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT`.
